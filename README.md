# WELCOME TO REMNANT
### Made by: Pedro Blanco & Stanley Eng
### Built with: ElevenLabs, Better-Auth, Next.JS, Prisma, Neon, React, TypeScript, Tailwind

# What we made:
Remnant is a solution to long distance relationships. In today's fast moving digital age, people text more than call, 
and studies have proven that hearing the voices of loved ones can decrease anxiety. Due to this we built Remnant, an application 
that takes in user voice recordings to clone their voice using ElevenLabs, and lets users create and join a family so they can 
share their moments with their loved ones by simply typing, while allowing others to still hear their voice.
